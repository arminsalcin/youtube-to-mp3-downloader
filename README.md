# Youtube to MP3 Downloader

**Clone and run for a quick way to see Electron in action.**

This is a minimal Electron application based on the [Quick Start Guide](https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/quick-start) within the Electron documentation.

It takes YouTube song URL as input and download that to MP3 to your computer, with some tags on the file as well (i.e. cover artwork, artist, album, etc.)

If you already have downloaded bunch of MP3s that you want to tag with tags, you can use this [project](https://github.com/fajicbenjamin/mp3-metadata-app) instead.
